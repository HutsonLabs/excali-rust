## 2026-09-27 · ex-005 · Enable GitHub Pages source = GitHub Actions and confirm first deploy

GitHub Pages now deploys from GitHub Actions, and the site is live at its configured `base_url`. A new `smoke` job runs after each deploy to main. It fails the workflow unless the home page returns HTTP 200 with the expected title. `scripts/site/zola.sh` now also works with the bash 3.2 that ships with macOS. PR: [#3](https://github.com/HutsonLabs/excali-rust/pull/3).
